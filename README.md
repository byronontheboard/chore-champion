# Chore Champion | ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ
When my collegues and I came together to produce this application, our intent was set on providing the user with an interface that would allow them to efficiently list and manage their daily tasks; and subsequently 'knockout' those tasks with ease to become the ___Chore Champion___ they were always destined to be!
